# Analysis on Life Expectancy using Bayesian Linear Regression
## Instructions
This project applies Bayesian Linear Regression to analyze factors affecting life expectancy across different regions. The goal is to build a probabilistic model that quantifies uncertainty while estimating the impact of key predictors such as GDP, healthcare expenditure, literacy rate, and lifestyle factors on life expectancy.

## Key Components:
Dataset: Includes life expectancy data with socioeconomic and health-related variables.
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features.
Bayesian Modeling: Implementing Bayesian Linear Regression to estimate coefficients with credible intervals instead of point estimates.
Inference & Interpretation: Understanding posterior distributions to assess the strength and uncertainty of predictor effects.
Visualization: Plotting predictive distributions, credibility intervals, and parameter uncertainty.

This analysis provides a robust probabilistic approach to understanding life expectancy variations, making it more interpretable than traditional regression models.
These experiences required proficiency in descriptive analysis, data visualization, bivariate correlation, standardization, and advanced model applications.
